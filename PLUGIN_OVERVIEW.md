# Kubiks - Executive Overview

## üéØ Plugin Summary

**Kubiks** is a powerful service map visualization panel for Grafana that transforms traditional monitoring dashboards into interactive, visual representations of distributed systems and microservices architectures.

## üåü Why Kubiks?

### The Challenge
Modern distributed systems consist of hundreds of interconnected services, making it difficult to:
- **Understand service relationships** and dependencies
- **Identify bottlenecks** and failure points quickly
- **Monitor system health** across complex topologies
- **Troubleshoot issues** in distributed environments
- **Communicate architecture** to stakeholders

### The Solution
Kubiks transforms your existing Grafana data into intuitive service maps that provide:
- **Visual topology mapping** of your entire system
- **Real-time health monitoring** with status indicators
- **Interactive exploration** of service relationships
- **Contextual drill-down** to detailed metrics and logs
- **Customizable displays** for different audiences

## üè¢ Business Value

### For Engineering Teams
- **Faster incident response** through visual service mapping
- **Improved system understanding** for new team members
- **Better capacity planning** with topology-aware metrics
- **Enhanced collaboration** across microservices teams

### For Operations
- **Proactive monitoring** with visual health indicators
- **Streamlined troubleshooting** workflows
- **Better resource allocation** decisions
- **Reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR)**

### For Management
- **Clear system overview** for technical discussions
- **Risk assessment** through dependency visualization
- **Progress tracking** for modernization initiatives
- **Investment justification** for infrastructure improvements

## üîß Key Capabilities

### 1. Dynamic Service Discovery
- Automatically generates maps from existing Grafana queries
- Supports any data source (Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, etc.)
- Real-time updates as services come online or go offline

### 2. Rich Visualization Options
- **Multiple layout algorithms**: Tree, grid, and force-directed positioning
- **Custom styling**: Icons, colors, and visual themes
- **Progressive detail**: Show more information at different zoom levels
- **Interactive elements**: Click, hover, and context menus

### 3. Flexible Configuration
- **Element types**: Services, connections, and logical groups
- **Display options**: Progress bars, status badges, metrics, tags
- **Data binding**: Link visual elements to specific query fields
- **Dashboard integration**: Embed panels and cross-link dashboards

### 4. Advanced Interactions
- **Service details**: Comprehensive slide-out panels
- **Connection analysis**: Traffic flow and error rate visualization
- **Search and filter**: Find specific services in large topologies
- **Context actions**: Quick navigation to related dashboards

## üìä Use Cases

**Solution**: Create interactive service maps showing health, dependencies, and traffic flow
**Benefit**: Reduce troubleshooting time from hours to minutes

### 2. System Architecture Documentation
**Scenario**: Document and communicate system architecture to stakeholders
**Solution**: Generate visual topology maps with embedded documentation
**Benefit**: Improved understanding and faster onboarding

### 3. Capacity Planning
**Scenario**: Plan infrastructure scaling based on service relationships
**Solution**: Visualize resource utilization across service dependencies
**Benefit**: Data-driven scaling decisions and cost optimization

### 4. Incident Response
**Scenario**: Quickly identify affected services during outages
**Solution**: Real-time health visualization with dependency mapping
**Benefit**: Faster incident isolation and resolution

### 5. Compliance and Audit
**Scenario**: Demonstrate system monitoring and observability capabilities
**Solution**: Create comprehensive visual dashboards for auditors
**Benefit**: Simplified compliance reporting and audit preparation

## üé® Example Configurations

      - Type: "progress" (CPU usage)
      - Type: "progress" (Memory usage)
```

### Network Topology
```yaml
Elements:
  - Name: "Service Connections"
    Type: "connection"
    Source: "network_metrics"
    Layout:
      - Type: "from"
      - Type: "to"
      - Type: "keyValue" (RPS, latency, errors)
```

### Dashboard Integration
```yaml
Elements:
  - Name: "Service Details"
    Type: "element"
    Layout:
      - Type: "panel"
        Source: "dashboard_uid/panel_id"
        Variables: {"service": "service_name"}
```
