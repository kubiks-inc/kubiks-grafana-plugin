# Publishing Guide - Grafana Plugin Catalog Submission

This guide walks you through the process of publishing the Kubiks Service Map Plugin to the official Grafana Plugin Catalog.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before submitting your plugin, ensure you have:

### 1. Grafana Cloud Account
- Create an account at [grafana.com/signup](https://grafana.com/signup)
- Verify your email address
- Complete your profile information

### 2. Plugin ID Verification
- The plugin ID in `src/plugin.json` must match your Grafana Cloud account slug
- Current ID: `kubiks-kubiks-panel`
- Your account slug should be `kubiks` for this to work

### 3. API Key Generation
- Log into your Grafana Cloud account
- Navigate to **Administration** ‚Üí **API Keys**
- Create a new API key with **PluginPublisher** role
- Save this key securely - you'll need it for signing

### 4. Repository Setup
- Ensure your repository is public on GitHub
- Add the API key as a repository secret named `GRAFANA_API_KEY`
- Verify all workflows are properly configured

## üîß Plugin Signing Setup

### 1. Add Repository Secret
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `GRAFANA_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your Grafana Cloud API key
6. Click **Add secret**

### 2. Update Release Workflow
The release workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml` needs to be updated to enable signing:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  release:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - uses: grafana/plugin-actions/build-plugin@main
        with:
          # Enable plugin signing
          policy_token: ${{ secrets.GRAFANA_API_KEY }}
```

## üöÄ Release Process

### 1. Prepare Release
Before creating a release, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run test:ci`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] E2E tests pass (`npm run e2e`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Version is bumped in `package.json`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated

### 2. Create Version Tag
```bash
# Update version (choose appropriate level)
npm version patch  # For bug fixes (0.3.1 ‚Üí 0.3.2)
npm version minor  # For new features (0.3.1 ‚Üí 0.4.0)
npm version major  # For breaking changes (0.3.1 ‚Üí 1.0.0)

# Push with tags
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Build
The release workflow will automatically:
- Build the plugin frontend and backend
- Run tests and validations
- Sign the plugin with your API key
- Create a draft release with assets
- Generate SHA1 checksums

### 4. Review Draft Release
1. Go to your repository's **Releases** page
2. Find the draft release created by GitHub Actions
3. Review the generated release notes
4. Check that signing completed successfully
5. Verify the `.zip` and `.zip.sha1` files are present
